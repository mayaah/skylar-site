            <p> In Skylar's demonstration video, a user will select the wristwatch as the mobile unit's destination and the mobile unit will take off from the base, fly to the wristwatch's location past old and new obstacles, hover near the wristwatch, fly back to the base, and dock itself to begin charging.<br><br>Managing Skylar's controls, you would make these actions possible by using and improving upon the theory I've written for the steps and coding it for a Raspberry Pi. Furthermore, managing Skylar's backend, you would work closely with the UI software development and help plan Skylar's architecture beyond the prototype.</p>

            <p>You're probably used to having technology in your home, a smartphone in your pocket and a smartwatch on your wrist. But Skylar isn't being made for you - it's being made for demographics typically either new to, wary of or ignored by current technology. If that challenge sounds interesting to you, you're in the right place.<br><br>
            Managing hardware design, you would be creating Skylar's physical look. You would interact with community members of the target market, learning their design wants and pitching them your ideas, and design the base, wristwatch and aerial mobile unit. Though largely self-driven, you would collaborate with the person handling mechanical engineering to ensure the design is practical.</p>

      <center><h3>GENERAL TERMS</h3></center>
      <center><p style="width: 80%; line-height: 2em; text-align: left;">1. Schedule: If you function best alone in your underwear from 1am-6am, go for it. But, we will meet for approximately a half hour per week to review the current deliverable and/or get information on the next one. We can decide together when this meeting will be. You'll share a list of hours during which you're typically free, so others and I know when we can reach you and vice-versa.
      <br><br>
      2. Deliverable-based Work: We will agree on a total payment amount for your work done, which will be paid upon my approving the work. To keep each other accountable, we will break down the final deliverable into smaller deliverables with clear expectations and break down the total payment similarly. In order to receive payment, you will be expected to submit work that meets the expectations by the due-date, so please ask questions and use the meetings to make sure you’re on the right path. Believe me, I don’t want to waste my time either.
      <br><br>
      3. Payment: You will be paid upon my approving the deliverable. I can pay through likely whatever means you want - Venmo, cash, check, PayPal, etc. If I ask you to go above and beyond the original assignment or you do so on your own and I approve of the additional work, I will pay you proportionally more.
      <br><br>
      4. Skill Expectations: I don't expect you to know everything about your task at first. But, I expect you to take full advantage of this opportunity to develop and apply skills you would, one day, want to mastering. Skylar has been a tremendous growing and educational experience for me and I hope it can be the same for you.</p><center>
